### Description of the used architecture

I used mongodb + express + nodejs with babel js to use es6 syntax, this solution was thinked because mongodb and document oriented databases are easy to create new schemas of data, i am using mongoose ODM too.

I am using a array of routes and schemas to create mongodb documents.

First of all: **Dependencies**

 * Javascript dependencies are listed on package.json
 * node.js v6+
 * npm
 * mongodb
 * if you want to see the data stored install robomongo 3t too
 * docker (next version)
 
 
**How to run this application?**

``npm install && npm start``

**How to run tests of this application?**

``npm test``

**How to run this application in docker?**

``next version``
